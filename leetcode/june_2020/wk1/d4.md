## Reverse String

Question:  
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
```

Example 1:  
```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

Example 2:  
```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

Solution: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        const int length = s.size();
        int p1 = 0, p2 = length-1;
        while(p2 > p1){
            const char temp = s[p1];
            s[p1] = s[p2];
            s[p2] = temp;
            p1++;
            p2--;
        }
        return;
    }
};
```

Explaination:  
Noething to crazy here, just using a 2 pointer approach and when `p2` is infront of `p1`, break the loop

Time Complexity:  
O(N/2) ? Because we only ever go half way?  
O(N) Because we access every element once?  

Space Complexity:  
O(2) -> O(1) Constant space becuase we ever need temp and 2 pointers.
