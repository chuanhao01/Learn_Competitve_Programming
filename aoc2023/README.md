# AOC2023

So AOC is back for 2023 and I decided to use `rust` mainly because I have liked development in it so far and I wanted to have a reason to code more `rust` :D.
I have also managed to complete the most number of questions on my own and in general this year too.

Some screenshots for history sake:
